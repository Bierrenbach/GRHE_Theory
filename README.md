# GRHE: Gravidade Regenerativa e Homeostase Espacial (Regenerative Gravity and Spatial Homeostasis)

Welcome to the GRHE project, a theoretical framework proposing **Gravidade Regenerativa e Homeostase Espacial** (Regenerative Gravity and Spatial Homeostasis) to model gravitational interactions through a dynamic field \(\Psi(r, t)\) with regenerative and self-balancing properties. This repository supports a manuscript submitted to *General Relativity and Gravitation* and invites collaboration for empirical validation.

## Overview
The GRHE unifies gravitational phenomena with regenerative wave dynamics and spatial homeostasis, tested against Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, and gravitational lensing. Developed by an independent researcher, this project seeks to engage the scientific community in testing and expanding the theory.

## Repository Structure
- **docs/**: Manuscript, supplementary material, and figures (e.g., BAO regenerative plots).
- **data/**: Observational (DESI DR2, CAMB) and simulated GRHE datasets.
- **code/**: Python scripts for simulations (regenerative waves, homeostasis models) and analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GRHE-Project.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run simulations: See `code/simulations/` for scripts like `grhe_bao_regenerative.py`.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to validate GRHE predictions, optimize code, or extend the theory. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
