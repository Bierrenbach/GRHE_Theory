Regenerative Gravity and Homeostatic Equilibrium (GRHE): A Unified Cosmological Framework
# GRHE â€“ Regenerative Gravity and Homeostatic Equilibrium

## Overview

The GRHE theory proposes a unifying functional framework that reinterprets gravitational phenomena, cosmic expansion, and quantum anomalies without relying on dark matter, dark energy, or space-time singularities. It introduces a regenerative gravitational dynamic that seeks equilibrium through continuous interaction with the functional structure of space.

## Key Features

- Eliminates the need for dark energy and dark matter
- Offers an organic alternative to space-time curvature
- Mathematically validated across:
  - Galactic rotation curves
  - Pioneer anomaly
  - Pulsars and binary systems
  - Orbital precession
  - Thermodynamic analogies
  - Functional visualization of gravitational structure
